# ~~~~
# The default session timeout for the app is 15 minutes (900seconds).

# timeout 15 minutes after login (regardless of user activity).
# session.maxAge=900

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!
